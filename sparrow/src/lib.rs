//! Sparrow is a fast, low-level, lightweight in-memory database.
//! The project is under active development and new features are shipped every week! ðŸ¥³
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! For now Sparrow runs using two threads:
//! - The engine is ran in one thread and executes commands received
//! through an input consumer and sends the output using an output producer.
//! - The TCP server is ran in another thread. It receives commands from socket connections
//! and send them to the engine using an input producer. The outputs are retrieved using an output consumer.
//!
//! ```rust
//! async {
//!   use sparrow::net::run_tcp_server;
//!   use sparrow::core::Engine;
//!
//!   let mut engine = Engine::new();
//!   let (sender, bus) = engine.init(256);
//!
//!   std::thread::spawn(move || engine.run().unwrap());
//!   run_tcp_server("127.0.0.1:8080".parse().unwrap(), 256, sender, &bus).await.unwrap();
//! };
//! ```
